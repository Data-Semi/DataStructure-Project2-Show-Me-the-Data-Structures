# DataStructure-Project2-Show-Me-the-Data-Structures  
This is the 2nd project of Udacity's Data Structures & Algorithms Nanodegree Program.  
I have used data structures like Linked List, Recursion, Priority queue, Queue in this project.

I have written 6 sets of files to answer 6 problems as below.

1. LRU Cashe problem  
problem_1.py, explanation_1.md

2. File Recursion  
problem_2.py, explanation_2.md

3. Huffman Coding  
problem_3.py, explanation_3.md  

4. Active Directory  
problem_4.py, explanation_4.md

5. Blockchain  
problem_5.py, explanation_5.md

6. Union and Intersection  
problem_6.py, explanation_6.md

### Description of the solutions

The description of 6 problems is included in each jupyter notes inside the folder [__Project2_jupyter_notes](https://github.com/Data-Semi/DataStructure-Project2-Show-Me-the-Data-Structures/tree/main/__Project2_jupyter_notes).  
Code solutions are in a separate file like "problem_1.py" which includes at least 3 test cases for each solution.  
For each test case, I wrote the function call with the input to test and print it to the console.
At least 2 of these are edge cases, testing inputs such as null values, empty inputs, unusually large values, etc.  
An explanation for each question is in a markdown file like "explanation_1.md" which explaines why did I use that data structure and efficiency (time and space) of your solution.

Note: Time complexity for reading the input will not be considered in the overall complexity of the solution.

### Description of folders

[__Project2_jupyter_notes](https://github.com/Data-Semi/DataStructure-Project2-Show-Me-the-Data-Structures/tree/main/__Project2_jupyter_notes)  
This folder is for reference. includes jupyter notebooks of the solutions.

[python_files_from_notes](https://github.com/Data-Semi/DataStructure-Project2-Show-Me-the-Data-Structures/tree/main/python_files_from_notes)  
This folder is for reference. It includes files downloaded by jupyter notes above.

[testdir](https://github.com/Data-Semi/DataStructure-Project2-Show-Me-the-Data-Structures/tree/main/testdir)  
It is needed to run prblem_2.py which has solutions code of the "File Recursion" problem.

### Special thanks
Thanks to Udacity's mentors who helped me improve my coding and analysis skills.  

### Environment
This program requires Python3.7~ , because it uses the data type ordinary Dictionary as ordered Dictionary.
