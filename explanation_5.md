## Program structure
### Methods
I implemented the class `BlockChain(object)` with a linked list. Every node is an object of the `Block` class.
The hash value inside a node `now_hash` is calculated from `timestamp` the Greenwich Mean Time timestamp of the node has been created, `data` the data of current node and `previous_hash` the hash value of previous node.

## Time Coplexity
Every operation in the program has time complexity O(1).
Therefore, the program's time complexity is O(1).
